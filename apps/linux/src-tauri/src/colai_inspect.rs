//! What a window says it is showing, as the desktop itself reports it.
//!
//! Only ever asked one question: what is the address of the page or folder in front of
//! you. A browser knows its own URL exactly, and a mark that carries it saves an agent
//! the round trip of working out which page a screenshot came from — which is the whole
//! reason any of this is here.
//!
//! Over the D-Bus connection the app already has a client for, rather than the `atspi`
//! crate: the interfaces used here are two methods on a stable specification, and taking
//! a dependency to spell them differently would mean owning its version alignment with
//! zbus forever.
//!
//! It is honest about its reach. GTK applications answer; Chromium and Electron ones
//! expose nothing unless they believe a screen reader is present, which on a developer's
//! desk is most of the windows. Measured on this machine: holding a connection open does
//! not wake them — accessibility has to be switched on. So a window that says nothing
//! produces no address rather than an invented one, and the message says the URL was not
//! available rather than going quiet about it.
