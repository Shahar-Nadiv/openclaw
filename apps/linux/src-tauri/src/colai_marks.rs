//! What a mark *is*, and which pixels it turns out to be about.
//!
//! A mark arrives from the page as fractions of a screen: a shape, some points, and a
//! tool that says what was meant by them. Before anything can be photographed, three
//! questions have to be answered about it — where to crop, where its points fall inside
//! that crop, and whether the shape gets drawn back onto the picture. That is all this
//! is, and none of it needs a display, which is why it can be tested and why it lives
//! apart from the module that reaches for one.
//!
//! **The mark is drawn back on, sometimes.** A box or a circle survives being cropped —
//! the crop *is* the annotation. A pin has no size at all and a freehand stroke is a
//! shape rather than an area, so cropping either one produces a picture of some pixels
//! with no indication of what about them mattered. Those take the ground around them
//! and wear the mark. And a picture whose whole meaning is another picture beside it
//! wears nothing, because the one difference an agent could be certain of would be ours.
