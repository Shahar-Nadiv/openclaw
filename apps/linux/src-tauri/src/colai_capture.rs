//! Turning a mark into a picture somebody can look at.
//!
//! The toolbar's whole promise is that you point at something and an agent sees what you
//! meant. A region drawn on glass is not that: it is a rectangle in fractions of a
//! screen, and it means nothing to anyone who was not looking at the screen. This is
//! where it becomes pixels.
//!
//! Two decisions shape everything here.
//!
//! **The mark is drawn back on.** A box or a circle survives being cropped — the crop is
//! the annotation. A pin has no size at all and a freehand stroke is a shape rather than
//! an area, so cropping either one produces a picture of some pixels with no indication
//! of what about them mattered. Those take the ground around them and wear the mark.
//!
//! **The bytes stay here.** A screenshot is a megabyte and the page has no use for it: it
//! shows a thumbnail and knows the mark's name. Sending the full image to the page and
//! back again would put that megabyte through the IPC boundary twice for nothing.
