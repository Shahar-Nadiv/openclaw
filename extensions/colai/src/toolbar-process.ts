// real process in it: everything else here decides something, this one starts and stops a
// window somebody is looking at.
//
// Both directions go through the toolbar's own front door. Running the binary again hands
// the arguments to the copy already on screen — that is how `openclaw colai toggle`
// works — so starting and stopping are the same mechanism, and it is the same mechanism
// on every platform. Signalling a pid was neither: finding the pid meant reading `/proc`,
// and on Windows Node maps SIGTERM to `TerminateProcess`, which gives a window somebody
// is looking at no chance to put anything down.
