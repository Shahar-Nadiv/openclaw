# Install colai the way somebody else would, on a machine that has never seen it.
#
# `openclaw plugins install -l <dir>` on this desktop proves the wiring and close to
# nothing else: there is a configured Gateway here, a Rust toolchain, every header, and a
# warm cargo cache that turns a multi-minute cold build into seconds — and `-l` links the
# working tree, so a file missing from `package.json` still resolves.
#
# So this packs the plugin the way npm would, hands the tarball to a released OpenClaw
# inside a container, and reports what happened. Four things it can catch that a local
# link cannot:
#
#   1. packaging      — only what `files` ships is there
#   2. the toolbar    — it ships already built, because OpenClaw installs plugins with
#                       `--ignore-scripts` and nothing can compile on the far machine
#   3. protocol drift — a released `openclaw`, not the fork this was cut from
#   4. uninstall      — nothing left behind
#
# Usage:
#   ./fresh-install.sh                    every variant
#   ./fresh-install.sh jammy              one variant
#   ./fresh-install.sh --display jammy    pass this desktop's screen in, so it can draw
#   ./fresh-install.sh --keep jammy       leave the image behind, for iterating
#
# Variants are distributions now, not toolchain combinations. `jammy` is the one that
# matters: Ubuntu 22.04 is glibc 2.35, which is exactly the floor the package claims, so a
# binary built one release too new passes everything else here and fails that.

# These used to be about whether a toolchain was present, which was the right question
# when it was not yet certain the plugin could avoid compiling on the installing machine.
# It can — it ships a binary — so the question that replaced it is how old a Linux that
# binary reaches, and whether it says something useful where it cannot run at all.
#
# `jammy` is the one that matters. The package claims a glibc floor of 2.35 and Ubuntu
# 22.04 *is* 2.35, so it is the exact edge: a binary built one release too new passes every
# other variant here and fails this one. The old matrix could not fail on that, because
