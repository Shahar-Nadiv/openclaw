// colai: point at anything on screen and hand it to an agent.
//
// This is only the toolbar. It was built inside OpenClaw's Linux desktop app, which is
// where the Gateway client, the tray and the window all already existed — and which is
// why nobody could install it without running that fork. Here it is its own program, so
// a plugin can put it on somebody's machine.
//
// What that costs is one copy: `gateway_ws`, `gateway`, `cli` and
// `gateway_device_identity` came across from the desktop app, trimmed to what the
// toolbar calls. See the header on `gateway_ws.rs`.
//
// What it does not need is most of that app — Quick Chat, the updater, the installer,
// discovery, sleep handling. Fourteen thousand lines the toolbar never called.
//
// The tray it does keep. The toolbar can be put away from its own keyboard and has no
// other window to bring it back, and it cannot add an entry to OpenClaw's — that menu is
// compiled into OpenClaw's desktop app, with no seam for a plugin, and this plugin does
// not change OpenClaw. So it carries an icon of its own, beside OpenClaw's, which is what
// staying out of somebody else's source costs.
