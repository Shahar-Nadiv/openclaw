// The one way in that does not require the toolbar to already have your attention.
//
// Every other shortcut this program offers is a single letter handled by the page, and
// the page only hears a key once the overlay has taken the keyboard — which it does when
// a panel opens and at no other time. So the rail advertised eleven shortcuts that could
// not be reached from the desktop, which is where somebody is when they want to mark
// something. `V`, `P`, `D` and `B` were decoration.
//
// This is the binding that fixes that: it brings the toolbar up and hands it the
// keyboard, so the letters mean what the keys say they mean.
