// The toolbar's own place in the system tray.
//
// The toolbar can be put away from its own keyboard, and standing alone it has no other
// window — so without this, somebody who pressed Escape had nothing left on screen to
// press and no way back except killing the process and letting OpenClaw start it again.
//
// It ticked a menu item in the OpenClaw desktop app before this program was cut out of
// it. That app is not what installs the toolbar any more, and a plugin cannot reach that
// menu: it is compiled into OpenClaw's desktop app with no seam for one, and this plugin
// does not change OpenClaw. So the toolbar carries its own icon — a second one beside
// OpenClaw's, which is the honest cost of staying out of OpenClaw's source.
