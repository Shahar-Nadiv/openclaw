//! Components and design systems brought in from somewhere else.
//!
//! The design tools photograph a region and ask an agent to make something like it. This
//! is the other direction: a thing that already exists in a catalogue, put *into* the
//! region that was marked. The mark still says where; the library says what.
//!
//! Nothing here holds an account. Whatever catalogue somebody has connected is connected
//! to their agent, and this borrows it through the Gateway's own `tools.invoke` — so the
//! search runs as the agent, with the agent's credentials, and colai stores none of it.
//! It also means a second catalogue is an entry in the table below rather than a second
//! integration.
//!
//! What this must never do is spend somebody's money to draw a menu. Browsing is free
//! metadata; fetching a component's source is paid and counted, and it belongs to the
//! agent doing the work once, on the one thing that was actually chosen. The table names
//! only the free calls for exactly that reason.
