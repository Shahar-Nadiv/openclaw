//! Which window somebody is actually looking at, moment to moment.
//!
//! A mark is a place in an application, not a place on the desktop. To draw one only
//! while its own window is in front — and at that window's rectangle *now* rather than
//! the one it had when the mark was made — the page needs to be told about the front
//! window as it changes. That is all this does: watch, and say when it differs.
//!
//! Read straight from X rather than through `xprop` and `xwininfo`. Those spawn a process
//! per question, which is fine for the once-per-mark question they answer elsewhere and
//! absurd several times a second. Three small round trips on a socket cost microseconds.
//!
//! Polled rather than driven by events. Xlib's event masks would be cheaper again, but
//! they bring error handlers, races on windows that die between the select and the read,
//! and a second event loop; a tenth of a second of latency on "which window is in front"
//! is not worth any of that. What matters for cost is that nothing is *sent* unless the
//! answer changed, and that is the part with a test on it.
