//! Handing what was marked to whoever is receiving it.
//!
//! The toolbar offers three kinds of receiver — an agent, a conversation the Gateway is
//! holding, and a conversation held in another agent entirely — and they look like three
//! different things on the menu. They are not three different sends. Every one of them
//! resolves to a session key, and from there a message with pictures attached goes out
//! the same way for all of them.
//!
//! The message itself is composed in the page, not here. What an agent reads is a
//! product decision that belongs next to the marks somebody made, and it is a pure
//! function there with tests on it. This module's job is to resolve a receiver, attach
//! the pictures, and say what happened.
