// One send, several doors into it. A mark can go from its own popup, from the composer
// with several others, or on its own because a watched region moved while nobody was
// looking — and the last of those must leave a half-written note and a chosen tool
// exactly as it found them, which is the only thing that makes those three different.

// Deciding what to do with something you marked, and who gets it.

// The popup that opens on a finished mark, the tray of everything kept, the composer
// that sends a batch, and the menu of who could receive it. Apart from the page because
// it answers a different question: the rail is about pointing at things, and all of
// this is about what happens next.
//
// A classic script like the rest of the toolbar, sharing one global scope with it. It
// reads `el` and `state` from toolbar.js, which is loaded first.
