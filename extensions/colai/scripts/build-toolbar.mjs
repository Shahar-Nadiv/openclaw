// The toolbar is a Tauri program, so somebody has to compile it. Not the installing
// machine: OpenClaw installs plugins with `--ignore-scripts`, always, with no flag and
// no config to opt in — `createSafeNpmInstallArgs` in `src/infra/safe-package-install.ts`
// puts it in every managed npm install. A `postinstall` here would never run, and asking
// somebody who wants a toolbar for a Rust toolchain and GTK headers was never a good
// trade anyway. So the toolbar travels already built, in `bin/`, and this is what puts
// it there before the package is packed.
